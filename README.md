# Quantified Self Front-end
Use the app: [Quantified-Self](https://quantified-self-app.surge.sh/)

Quantified self lets you keep track of what you're made of by allowing you to log your meals and count your calories, then look back at your trends!

It consumes a companion back-end API that's documented [here](https://github.com/hbellows/quantifiedSelfApi)

As a JavaScript practice project, think of it as an experiment in code. The code is in need of major structural refactoring, by my goal was to learn about promises, async vs. synchronous flow control, jQuery, and javascript datetimes, and to dabble in slightly more advanced javascript operations. Since the purpose was to experiment with different approaches and learn through trial and error, that refactor would be rather besides the point.
